To fix this:\n\n1. **Line Endings Configuration**: The `formatter` must be configured using the `ending` parameter to ensure generated line endings match the test's expectation.\n2. **Complete Tab Replacement**: The existing replacement only fixes tabs followed by a semicolon, but IE hacks may involve tabs in other contexts that should also be converted back to `\\9`.\n",
