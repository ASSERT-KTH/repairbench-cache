This `endIndex` is intended to mark the end of the *current* data block.\n\n2.  **Reading the `key` byte**:\n    ```java\n    int key = buf.readUnsignedByte();\n    ```\n    *   This reads the `key` byte. `buf.readerIndex()` advances to `R_start + 2`. At this point, `buf.readerIndex()` is at the start of the actual value data.\n\n3.  **Reading `value` data in `switch` cases**:\n    *   Each `case` block then reads `length` bytes corresponding to the `value` part.\n    *   After reading the `length` bytes, `buf.readerIndex()` becomes `(R_start + 2) + length`. This is the correct position for the start of the *next* data block.\n\n4.  **Advancing `readerIndex` to `endIndex`**:\n    ```java\n    buf.readerIndex(endIndex);\n    ```\n    *   This line attempts to set `buf.readerIndex()` to `length + R_start + 1`.\n    *   However, the `buf.readerIndex()` was already at `R_start + 2 + length`.\n    *   Therefore, the `readerIndex` is moved *backward* by one byte (`(R_start + 1 + length) - (R_start + 2 + length) = -1`).\n\nThis off-by-one backward movement causes the decoder to repeatedly re-read the last byte of the previous block as the length of the *next* block, leading to corrupt data parsing. This corrupted data could then be used in object construction or access, resulting in a `NullPointerException` when a method is called on a null reference or an incorrectly parsed object.\n\n**The Fix**:\nThe `endIndex` should be calculated based on the `readerIndex` *after* both the `length` and `key` bytes have been read, and then adding the `length` of the value data.\n",
