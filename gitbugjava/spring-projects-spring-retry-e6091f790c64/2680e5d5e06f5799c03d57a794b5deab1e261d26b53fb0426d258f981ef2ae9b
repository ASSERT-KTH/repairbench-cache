    "generation": "    if (this.maxDelay != null && this.delay != null) {\n        policy.setMaxInterval(\n                this.maxDelay > this.delay ? this.maxDelay : ExponentialBackOffPolicy.DEFAULT_MAX_INTERVAL);\n    }\n    ```\n    This has two potential issues:\n    *   It requires `this.delay` (initial interval) to be a non-null literal value to set `this.maxDelay`. If `this.delay` is configured via `this.delaySupplier`, then `this.maxDelay` (if literal) would be ignored.\n    *   If `this.maxDelay <= this.delay`, it uses `ExponentialBackOffPolicy.DEFAULT_MAX_INTERVAL` instead of `this.maxDelay`. The `ExponentialBackOffPolicy` itself clamps `maxInterval` to be at least `initialInterval`. For example, if `initialInterval=1000` and `maxDelay=500` is set, the policy would use `maxInterval=1000`. The builder's current logic would instead use `DEFAULT_MAX_INTERVAL` (e.g., 30000ms), which might be unexpected. It's generally better to pass the configured value to the policy and let the policy manage its internal consistency.\n\n2.  **UniformRandomBackOffPolicy Selection**:\n    The original condition for choosing `UniformRandomBackOffPolicy` is:\n    ```java\n    if (this.maxDelay != null && this.delay != null && this.maxDelay > this.delay) {\n        // ... create UniformRandomBackOffPolicy\n    }\n    ```\n    This is restrictive. It doesn't account for:\n    *   Cases where `delaySupplier` or `maxDelaySupplier` are used.\n    *   Cases where only `maxDelay` is set (and `delay` should perhaps default, e.g. to `UniformRandomBackOffPolicy`'s default minimum). If this condition is false, it falls back to `FixedBackOffPolicy`, and the `maxDelay` would be ignored.\n\nThe fix addresses these points to make policy selection and configuration more robust and align with common expectations for such a builder.\n",
