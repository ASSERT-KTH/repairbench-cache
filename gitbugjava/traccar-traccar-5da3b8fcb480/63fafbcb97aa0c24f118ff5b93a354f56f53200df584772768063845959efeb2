The problem arises in the 0xFE subtype handling. The failing test expects a battery level of 45 but received null instead. \n\nLet me look at the problematic part. In the original code, for the 0xFE subtype, after reading the `mark` (which in the test is 0x7C, indicating nested entries), the code was still trying to read another byte for the battery level outside the loop that processes those nested entries. This causes an extra byte read beyond the allocated data length, leading either to an unreadable byte or overwriting the valid value set inside the loop with an incorrect one.\n\nThe key fix is to ensure the battery level is not read again after the nested loop. Instead, the `set` call should only be made if the `mark` is *not* 0x7C. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Problem:**\n   - In the 0xFE case, when the mark is 0x7C (indicating nested entries), the code's loop processes extensions inside this structure. After the loop, the code reads another byte for the battery level, which was already handled within the loop. This leads to incorrect value or skipping the valid battery level entry.\n\n2. **Modify the `0xFE` Case Handling:**\n   - The battery level setting line (`position.set(...)`) is moved into an `else` clause after checking if `mark == 0x7C`.\n   - Now, the battery level is only set if the data isn't using nested entries, thus avoiding the extra read when there are extensions.\n\n3. **Ensure Buffer Reader Offset Correct:**\n   - The `readerIndex` after each loop runs correctly ends at `endIndex`, preventing the reader from overshooting and reading invalid bytes.\n\nBy applying these changes, the function won't erroneously overwrite the battery level with incorrect or no data when processing nested extensions in the 0xFE subtype. This specifically fixes the test case where battery level is 45.\n\n### Final Fixed Code (\u53ea the function):\n",
