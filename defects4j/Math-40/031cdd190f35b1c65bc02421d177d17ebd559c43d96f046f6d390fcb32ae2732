This means a potentially useful initial sampling point (`getMax()`) is lost prematurely.\n6.  While the `x` array *should* generally be kept sorted for efficient inverse polynomial interpolation, the initial unsorted `x` array combined with the `nbPoints` logic leads to the loss of data.\n\nThe fix involves ensuring that the initial three points (`getMin()`, `getStartValue()`, `getMax()`) are always sorted by their x-values and then loaded into the `x` and `y` arrays. All three points should then be considered part of the initial active set (`nbPoints = 3`), and the `signChangeIndex` should be determined based on their sorted positions. This ensures that the `x` array is always sorted (among its `nbPoints` active elements) and prevents the premature loss of initial data points.\n\nHere's the corrected `doSolve` method:\n",
