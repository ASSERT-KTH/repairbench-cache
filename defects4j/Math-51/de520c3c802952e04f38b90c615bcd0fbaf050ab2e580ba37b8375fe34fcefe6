If `x1` (the old `x1`) becomes the new `x0`, and `f1` (the old `f1`) becomes the new `f0`, then `f1` (the value *before* assignment to `f0`) is the one that needs scaling. The scaling logic was entirely missing for this `if` block.\n\n2.  **`else` block**: This condition (`f1 * fx >= 0`) means that `x` and `x0` bracket the root. This implies `x` should replace `x1`. So, `(x1, f1)` is updated to `(x, fx)`, while `(x0, f0)` is kept. Therefore, `x0` is the potentially \"stuck\" point, and its function value `f0` should be scaled.\n    The original code correctly had the scaling for `f0` within this `else` block.\n\nThe fix involves adding the `switch` statement for Illinois and Pegasus methods into the `if (f1 * fx < 0)` block, targeting `f1` for scaling, similar to how `f0` is scaled in the `else` block. Also, ensure the `REGULA_FALSI` method is explicitly handled by `break` in the switch, rather than falling into `default`.\n\n**Detailed fix:**\n\n*   **In the `if (f1 * fx < 0)` block:**\n    *   Add a `switch (method)` statement.\n    *   For `ILLINOIS`, scale `f1` (e.g., `f1 *= 0.5;`).\n    *   For `PEGASUS`, scale `f1` using the Pegasus formula (`f1 *= f0 / (f0 + fx);`). Here, `f1` is the \"stuck\" value, `f0` is the \"other\" value, and `fx` is the function value of the new approximation.\n    *   Add a `case REGULA_FALSI: break;` to explicitly handle the standard method without scaling.\n    *   Keep the `default: throw new MathInternalError();` for unexpected methods.\n\nThis ensures that the appropriate bound's function value is scaled, regardless of which side is causing the stagnation.\n",
