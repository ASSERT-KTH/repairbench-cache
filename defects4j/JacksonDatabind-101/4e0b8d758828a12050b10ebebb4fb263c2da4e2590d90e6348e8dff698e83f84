Because `p.nextToken()` (step 1) is called *before* `tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p)` (step 2), `p` is pointing to the *value* token, not the field name token, when `copyCurrentStructure` is invoked. Thus, `copyCurrentStructure` only copies the value, not the field name.\n    *   More critically, `p.nextToken()` is called twice within the loop (`p.nextToken()` in step 1, and implicitly by `copyCurrentStructure` in step 2, and then `p.nextToken()` in step 3). This causes the parser to skip tokens. Specifically, `p.nextToken()` in step 3 causes the parser to move past the *next* field name or `END_OBJECT` token, effectively skipping it.\n\n**Fix:**\n\nThe corrected `while` loop should explicitly get the field name, write it to the `tokens` buffer, then advance the parser to the value and copy the value's structure. Finally, `t` should be updated to reflect the parser's *current* position, without an extra `p.nextToken()` that would cause skipping.\n\nThe fix changes the `while` loop to:\n1.  Read the `propName` using `p.getCurrentName()` while `p` is at `FIELD_NAME`.\n2.  Advance `p` to the `VALUE` token using `p.nextToken()`.\n3.  Write the `propName` to the `tokens` buffer using `tokens.writeFieldName(name)`.\n4.  Copy the `VALUE` structure to the `tokens` buffer using `tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p)`. This method also advances `p` past the copied value, to the next `FIELD_NAME` or `END_OBJECT`.\n5.  Update `t` by reading `p.getCurrentToken()`. This ensures `t` correctly reflects the token `p` is currently pointing at for the next loop condition check, without skipping.\n\nThis ensures that both the field name and its value are correctly buffered and that the parser state (`p` and `t`) is maintained correctly for subsequent iterations or final processing.\n",
