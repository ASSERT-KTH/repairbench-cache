    "generation": "    if (newRecord && (c < '0' || c > '9' && c < 'A' || c > 'Z' && c < 'a' || c > 'z')) {\n        quote = true;\n    }\n    ```\n    This condition attempts to quote a field if its first character (on a new record) is not alphanumeric. However, it's too broad. For example, a backslash (`\\`, ASCII 92) is not alphanumeric and falls into this condition (`c > 'Z' && c < 'a'` is true for `\\`). According to RFC4180, a backslash is generally considered \"TEXTDATA\" and doesn't inherently require quoting unless it's a delimiter, a quote character, or a newline.\n    The tests `testEscapeBackslash1`, `testEscapeBackslash4`, `testEscapeBackslash5` fail because the backslash input `\\` is incorrectly quoted as `'\\'` (when `QUOTE_CH` is `'`) instead of being printed as `\\`. Removing or refining this overly broad condition is necessary.\n    Similarly, `else if (c <= COMMENT)` and `if (c <= SP)` for the trailing character check are also quite broad and can lead to unintended quoting. A more standard `MINIMAL` approach quotes based on internal delimiters, quote characters, newlines, or leading/trailing spaces.\n\n2.  **Missing Escape Character Handling When Not Quoting:**\n    The function is named `printAndQuote`, and its main logic is to decide if quoting is needed. If `quote` is determined to be `false`, the code simply appends the raw value: `out.append(value, start, end);`.\n    ```java\n    if (!quote) {\n        // no encapsulation needed - write out the original value\n        out.append(value, start, end);\n        return;\n    }\n    ```\n    This `if (!quote)` block appears twice and critically **does not consider the `escapeChar`**. If `quote` is false, but an `escape` character is defined in the `CSVFormat` (e.g., `\\`), and the value contains characters that *should* be escaped (like the delimiter or the escape character itself), they are printed raw, leading to incorrect output. The `printAndEscape` helper function (used for `QuoteMode.NONE`) is designed for this. This common logic needs to be centralized and correctly dispatch to `printAndEscape` if `escapeChar` is present.\n\n3.  **Incorrect `pos` Reset for Quoting Loop:**\n    If `quote` is set to `true` by the `MINIMAL` mode's detection loop, the `pos` variable retains the index where the problematic character was found. However, the subsequent loop that actually performs the quoting (doubling `quoteChar`) needs to scan the *entire* `value` string from `offset`. The original code relies on `pos` implicitly for this loop, which could be wrong if `pos` is not reset to `offset`.\n\n**Proposed Fixes:**\n\n1.  **Refine `QuoteMode.MINIMAL` Logic:**\n    *   Remove the overly broad initial character checks (`if (newRecord && (c < '0' || ...))` and `else if (c <= COMMENT)`). These caused `\\` to be quoted.\n    *   Introduce explicit checks for leading and trailing `SP` (space character), which is a common requirement for `MINIMAL` quoting in CSV.\n    *   Keep the core logic that checks for `LF`, `CR`, `quoteChar`, `delimChar` internally.\n\n2.  **Centralize and Improve `if (!quote)` Handling:**\n    *   Remove the duplicate `if (!quote)` blocks.\n    *   Consolidate the unquoted path *after* the `switch` statement.\n    *   Inside this consolidated `if (!quote)` block, check if `getEscapeCharacter()` is non-null. If it is, delegate to `printAndEscape` for handling the unquoted value. Otherwise, proceed with a raw `out.append`.\n\n3.  **Reset `pos` for Quoting Loop:**\n    *   Before the final `while (pos < end)` loop that handles doubling the `quoteChar`, explicitly reset `pos = offset;` to ensure the entire value is scanned correctly.\n",
