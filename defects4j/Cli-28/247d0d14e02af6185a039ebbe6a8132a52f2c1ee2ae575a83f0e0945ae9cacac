This causes the entire `for` loop to terminate prematurely.\n3.  **Consequence of the Bug:** When the loop terminates, any remaining properties in the `properties` map are not processed. This leads to `cmd.hasOption()` returning `false` for options that should have been processed (e.g., option 'e' in `testPropertyOptionFlags` when 'a' or 'c' trigger the `break`).\n4.  **The Fix:** Replacing `break;` with `continue;` changes the behavior to:\n    *   If a flag option's value is *not* a \"true\" indicator, then simply skip adding *that specific option* to the `CommandLine` and proceed to the next property in the `for` loop. This correctly implements the desired logic (\"don't add the option to the CommandLine\") without stopping the processing of other properties.\n\nThis change ensures that all properties are correctly evaluated, allowing flag options to be added only when their corresponding property values indicate \"true\" (or equivalent), and argument-taking options to be processed regardless of their property value content (as long as they are valid arguments).\n",
