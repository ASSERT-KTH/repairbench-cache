Its purpose is to resolve the argument for `simpleMethod`.\n    *   Since `when(mock.otherMethod()).thenReturn(\"foo\")` was already executed, `invocationContainerImpl.hasAnswersForStubbing()` (which checks for an *ongoing* stubbing setup within *this mock's container*) is `false`.\n    *   `mockingProgress.pullVerificationMode()` is `null` because `verify` is targeting `mockTwo`, not `mock`.\n    *   Thus, the execution falls into the \"general invocation\" path where `mockingProgress.reportOngoingStubbing(ongoingStubbing);` is called.\n3.  **Consequence:** Calling `mockingProgress.reportOngoingStubbing()` in this context incorrectly sets a global Mockito state indicating that an ongoing stubbing is being set up for `mock`. This can interfere with subsequent verification calls and overall Mockito state. The test `shouldAllowVerifyingWhenOtherMockCallIsInTheSameLine` fails because the `never()` verification doesn't behave as expected, likely due to this corrupted `mockingProgress` state.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `mockingProgress.reportOngoingStubbing()` call, and the creation of `OngoingStubbingImpl`, should only occur when Mockito is explicitly in the process of setting up a new stubbing chain (i.e., immediately after `Mockito.when()` has been called).\n\n**Fix:**\n\n1.  **Refine Stubbing Setup Condition:** The initial `if` statement for stubbing setup needs to use the global `mockingProgress.hasOngoingStubbing()` flag, which correctly indicates if `Mockito.when()` was just invoked and an ongoing stubbing is expected. The previous `invocationContainerImpl.hasAnswersForStubbing()` was local to the mock's container and could be `false` even when a global `when` operation was in progress.\n2.  **Remove Misplaced `reportOngoingStubbing`:** The lines responsible for creating `OngoingStubbingImpl` and calling `mockingProgress.reportOngoingStubbing()` should be removed from the general invocation path (after `if (verificationMode != null)`). These operations are only relevant during the explicit setup of a `when().thenReturn()` (or similar) chain.\n\n**Fixed Code:**\n",
