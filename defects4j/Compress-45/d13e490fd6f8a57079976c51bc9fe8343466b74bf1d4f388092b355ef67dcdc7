Both of these internal methods are designed to fully format the value, including setting the leading byte (`0xff` or `0x80`) and filling the rest of the field. Calling them sequentially is redundant and can lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts if their implementations have subtle differences or checks.\n\n2.  **Redundant Final Lines:** The lines `buf[offset] = (byte) (negative ? 0xff : 0x80);` and `return offset + length;` at the end of the method are also redundant. Both `formatLongBinary` and `formatBigIntegerBinary` internally handle setting the leading byte and correctly return the `offset + length`.\n\nThe fix involves choosing a single, robust method for binary formatting and ensuring the main function's return value is derived from that method. `formatBigIntegerBinary` is generally preferred for its robustness, as it utilizes `BigInteger` for byte conversion, which handles the full range of `long` values accurately for various field lengths.\n\nBy removing the conditional `formatLongBinary` call and making `formatBigIntegerBinary` the sole binary formatter, the function becomes cleaner, more consistent, and avoids potential issues from redundant operations.\n\nThe corrected code for the `formatLongOctalOrBinaryBytes` function is provided below:\n",
