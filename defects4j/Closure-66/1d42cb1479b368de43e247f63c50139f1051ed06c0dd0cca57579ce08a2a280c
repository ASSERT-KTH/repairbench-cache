    "generation": "          case Token.STRING:\n            // Object literal keys are handled with OBJECTLIT\n            if (!NodeUtil.isObjectLitKey(n, n.getParent())) {\n              ensureTyped(t, n, STRING_TYPE);\n              // Object literal keys are not typeable\n            }\n            break;\n    ```\n    The comment `// Object literal keys are not typeable` and the `if` condition explicitly prevent `STRING` nodes that are object literal keys (e.g., `A` in `{A: 1}`) from having their type set by this `case`. When `ensureTyped` is skipped, `getJSType(n)` will return `NoType` (or `unknownType`), causing `doPercentTypedAccounting` to *not* increment `typedCount` for these nodes. The failing tests expect 100% typed nodes, implying these keys *should* be counted. This `if` condition needs to be removed so that `STRING` keys are always assigned `STRING_TYPE`.\n\n2.  **`Token.GET` and `Token.SET` cases:**\n    ```java\n          case Token.GET:\n          case Token.SET:\n            // Object literal keys are handled with OBJECTLIT\n            break;\n    ```\n    These cases are empty. `Token.GET` and `Token.SET` nodes represent accessor properties (e.g., `get foo() {}`, `set bar(x) {}`) within object literals. By default, `typeable` is `true`. However, since no `ensureTyped` is called here, their `JSType` will be `null` when `doPercentTypedAccounting` is called for them during their `visit` traversal, causing them to be skipped from `typedCount`. Their types *are* set later by `visitObjLitKey` (when the parent `OBJECTLIT` node is processed), but this happens *after* their own `visit` call. To ensure they are counted, their type needs to be set during their own `visit` call. Their type should be the type of the function node which is their first child.\n\n3.  **`Token.OBJECTLIT` case and `visitObjLitKey`:**\n    ```java\n          case Token.AND:\n          case Token.HOOK:\n          case Token.OBJECTLIT:\n          case Token.OR:\n            // ...\n            if (n.getType() == Token.OBJECTLIT) {\n              for (Node key : n.children()) { // BUG: iterates over all children (keys and values)\n                visitObjLitKey(t, key, n);\n              }\n            }\n            break;\n    ```\n    The loop `for (Node key : n.children())` iterates over *all* children of an `OBJECTLIT` node, which means it will pass both key nodes and value nodes to `visitObjLitKey`. `visitObjLitKey` is designed specifically for key nodes. Passing value nodes (like `NUMBER` literals) to `visitObjLitKey` can lead to incorrect type assignments (e.g., attempting to assign `STRING_TYPE` to a `NUMBER` value if it falls into the `else` block of `visitObjLitKey`). This loop needs to be corrected to iterate only over the key nodes (which are every other child, starting from the first).\n\nThe proposed fix addresses these three points to ensure all relevant nodes are correctly typed and accounted for, aligning with the \"100% typed\" expectation of the tests.\n",
