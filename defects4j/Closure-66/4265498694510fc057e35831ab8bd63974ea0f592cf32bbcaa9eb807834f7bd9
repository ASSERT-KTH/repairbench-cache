This makes the `if` condition `false`, and `ensureTyped(t, n, STRING_TYPE)` is **skipped**.\n    However, the `typeable` flag remains `true` (its initial value). At the end of the `visit` method, `if (typeable) { doPercentTypedAccounting(t, n); }` is executed.\n    The `doPercentTypedAccounting` method, common in type checkers, usually increments `typedCount` if `n.getJSType() != null` and `totalCount` unconditionally. Since `ensureTyped` was skipped, `n.getJSType()` for these string keys is `null` at this point. Thus, the string keys are counted in `totalCount` but **not** in `typedCount`.\n\n    This scenario creates the observed discrepancy:\n    *   `OBJECTLIT` (1 node) is typed and contributes to `typedCount` and `totalCount`.\n    *   `NUMBER` values (3 nodes in `testGetTypedPercent5`, 2 in `testGetTypedPercent6`) are typed and contribute to `typedCount` and `totalCount`.\n    *   `STRING` keys (3 nodes in `testGetTypedPercent5`, 2 in `testGetTypedPercent6`) are *not* explicitly typed by `ensureTyped` in this `visit` method's `STRING` case, but their `typeable` flag causes them to contribute only to `totalCount` (because their type is null).\n\nLet's re-calculate for `keys = {A: 1,B: 2,C: 3};`:\n*   `OBJECTLIT` node: 1 typed, 1 total.\n*   `NUMBER` nodes (1, 2, 3): 3 typed, 3 total.\n*   `STRING` nodes (A, B, C): 0 typed (because `n.getJSType()` is null), 3 total.\n\nTotal: 4 typed nodes, 7 total nodes. Percentage: `4/7 = 57.14%`. This is still not 66.67%.\n\n**Revisiting the `66.67%` value:**\nA percentage of `66.67%` is exactly `2/3`. This suggests that for every 3 nodes accounted for, 2 are typed.\nIf the `OBJECTLIT` node itself was NOT counted towards the total, or handled separately, then:\n*   Total nodes: 3 (NUMBER values) + 3 (STRING keys) = 6 nodes.\n*   Typed nodes: 3 (NUMBER values) + 0 (STRING keys) = 3 typed nodes.\n*   The `OBJECTLIT` node itself is typed. If it doesn't affect the `totalCount` (e.g., only `typedCount` is incremented for it or it's implicitly part of the total by context), and it means 1 more typed node, the count becomes 3 (NUMBERS) + 1 (OBJECTLIT) = 4 typed nodes.\n*   Then, 4 typed nodes / 6 total nodes = `4/6 = 2/3 = 66.67%`.\nThis is the only scenario that matches the observed `66.67%` current result. This implies `OBJECTLIT` contributes to the numerator (typed) but not the denominator (total) in the calculation of `getTypedPercent`.\n\nGiven the target is `100.0%`, this means the `STRING` keys that are currently causing `0 typed / 1 total` contribution (which makes it `4/6` instead of `6/6` if they were also typed) need to be correctly typed.\n\nThe fix is to ensure that `STRING` literal nodes, regardless of whether they are object literal keys or not, are assigned a `STRING_TYPE` using `ensureTyped`. The comment `// Object literal keys are not typeable` likely refers to a different aspect (e.g., they don't represent an expression that evaluates to a new value), but for the purpose of the `getTypedPercent` metric, they are expected to have a type.\n\n**Proposed fix:**\nRemove the `if (!NodeUtil.isObjectLitKey(n, n.getParent()))` condition in the `Token.STRING` case so that `ensureTyped(t, n, STRING_TYPE)` is always called for string literals. This will assign them a `JSType`, making them count towards the \"typed\" percentage.\n\nThe `GET` and `SET` cases are currently empty (`break`), which means `typeable` remains `true` and they would be counted as typeable. While getters/setters are declarations rather than expressions, the tests provided do not directly target these. For strict consistency with other declaration-like nodes (`VAR`, `FUNCTION`), one might set `typeable = false` for them, but the primary issue in the failing tests is with `STRING` keys. The most direct fix addressing the test failures is the change to the `STRING` case.\n",
