    "generation": "    if (firstTime || !fsal) {\n      // first stage\n      computeDerivatives(stepStart, y, yDotK[0]);\n    }\n    ```\n    This computes `yDotK[0]` (the derivative `k_0`) for the current step. If `fsal` is true and it's not the `firstTime`, `yDotK[0]` is expected to be loaded from the previous step's last derivative.\n\n2.  **Last stage calculation in the loop:**\n    ```java\n    // next stages\n    for (int k = 1; k < stages; ++k) {\n      // ... compute yTmp based on previous stages ...\n      computeDerivatives(stepStart + c[k-1] * stepSize, yTmp, yDotK[k]);\n    }\n    ```\n    The `yDotK[stages-1]` (the derivative `k_{s-1}` or `k_s` depending on indexing, let's call it `k_s` for clarity as `stages = s+1` if `k` goes `0..s-1`, but here `k` goes `1..s`) is computed based on `c[stages-2]` and an intermediate `yTmp`. This `yDotK[stages-1]` is not necessarily the derivative of the final state `y(t_{n+1})` at `t_{n+1}`.\n\n3.  **FSAL propagation:**\n    ```java\n    if (fsal) {\n      // save the last evaluation for the next step\n      System.arraycopy(yDotK[stages - 1], 0, yDotK[0], 0, y0.length);\n    }\n    ```\n    This line, located after the step has been accepted and `y` and `stepStart` have been updated to `y(t_{n+1})` and `t_{n+1}` respectively, copies the `yDotK[stages-1]` (which was computed using intermediate values) into `yDotK[0]` for the *next* step. This is incorrect if `yDotK[stages-1]` does not actually represent `f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})`.\n\n**The Bug:**\nThe core bug is that if `fsal` is true, the `yDotK[stages - 1]` value copied to `yDotK[0]` for the subsequent step is derived from an intermediate state and time, not the actual accepted state `y` at the end of the current step (`stepStart`). For the FSAL property to be valid, `yDotK[0]` for the next step *must* be `f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})`.\n\n**The Fix:**\nAfter a step has been accepted and the state `y` and time `stepStart` are updated to `y_{n+1}` and `t_{n+1}`, if the integrator is FSAL, we must recompute the derivative at this new point `(stepStart, y)` and store it in `yDotK[stages - 1]` *before* copying it to `yDotK[0]`. This ensures `yDotK[0]` for the next step is correct, maintaining the FSAL property.\n\nThe modified code block replaces the original `if (fsal)` block which only performed the `System.arraycopy`.\n",
