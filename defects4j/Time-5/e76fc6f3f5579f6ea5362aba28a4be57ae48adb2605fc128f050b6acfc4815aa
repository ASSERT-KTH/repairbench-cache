This is not\n     * true when daylight savings time is considered, and may also not be true\n     * for some chronologies. However, it is included as it is a useful operation\n     * for many applications and business rules.\n     * <p>\n     * If the period contains years or months, then the months will be\n     * normalized to be between 0 and 11. The days field and below will be\n     * normalized as necessary, however this will not overflow into the months\n     * field. Thus a period of 1 year 15 months will normalize to 2 years 3 months.\n     * But a period of 1 month 40 days will remain as 1 month 40 days.\n     * <p>\n     * The PeriodType parameter controls how the result is created.
