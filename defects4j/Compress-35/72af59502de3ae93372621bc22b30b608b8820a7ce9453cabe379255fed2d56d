It is stored as a six digit octal number with\n     * leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various\n     * implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility,\n     * ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and get the first six digits. In\n     * addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed.\n     * Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it\n     * as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included\n     * checksum.\n     * </blockquote>\n     * <p>\n     * The return value of this method should be treated as a best-effort\n     * heuristic rather than an absolute and final truth.
