Trying to iterate over a single `Node` object using a `for-each` loop will cause a `ClassCastException` or similar runtime error, effectively preventing these crucial cross-edges from being created.\n\n    When control is exiting the `finally` block, `computeFollowNode` should check if the `fromNode` (the original abnormal exit node, like a `RETURN` or `BREAK`) was previously rerouted through this `finally` block. If `fromNode` exists in `finallyMap`, it means its ultimate destination was saved there. We should create an edge from `fromNode` to that ultimate destination and then return that destination. If `fromNode` is not in `finallyMap`, it means control flow entered the `finally` block normally or an abnormal exit occurred *within* the `finally` block itself, in which case the normal follow of the `TRY` statement should be computed.\n\nHere's the fixed `computeFollowNode` function:\n",
