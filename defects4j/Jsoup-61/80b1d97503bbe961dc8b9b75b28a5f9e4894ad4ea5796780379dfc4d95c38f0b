This is a bug.\n    *   This condition needs to be refined to handle `hasClass(\"\")` correctly.\n\n3.  **Case-Insensitive Comparisons**: The `equalsIgnoreCase` and `regionMatches(true, ...)` calls correctly handle case-insensitivity for string comparisons. These parts of the code appear to be correct.\n\n**Proposed Fixes**:\n\n1.  **Add a `null` check for `classAttr`**: This prevents `NullPointerException` if the element has no `class` attribute and gracefully returns `false`. This is the most plausible reason for the `expected:<3> but was:<1>` error, as it would cause `hasClass` to return `false` for some elements where the `class` attribute was somehow not found (even if it should have been by Jsoup's parser).\n\n2.  **Correctly handle the `len == 0` (empty `classAttr`) case**: Separate the check for `len == 0` from `len < wantLen`. If `classAttr` is empty, it should only match if the `className` being sought is also empty.\n\nThe corrected function is provided below:\n",
