The buggy code sets `delta = 2 * lmNorm;` where `lmNorm` is the norm of the step *taken*. If `lmNorm` is small (e.g., as the algorithm approaches convergence), this could drastically shrink the trust region, preventing the algorithm from making further progress or affecting its convergence path. The `delta` parameter defines the maximum allowed step size, not directly derived from the step itself in this context.\n\n    **Buggy Code:**\n    ```java\n                } else if ((lmPar == 0) || (ratio >= 0.75)) {\n                    delta = 2 * lmNorm; // <-- BUG: Should be delta *= 2;\n                    lmPar *= 0.5;\n                }\n    ```\n    **Fix:** Change `delta = 2 * lmNorm;` to `delta *= 2;`.\n\nThe provided fix incorporates these two changes to align the algorithm more closely with standard Levenberg-Marquardt implementations, which should resolve the observed numerical discrepancies and test failures.\n",
