However, `tq.matchChomp(\"=\")` will be true, and a `value` (\"a\" in this case) will be successfully extracted. The `tq` will advance past `=a`. But then, the `else` block (for `key.length() != 0`) will execute `tq.consume()`. This `tq.consume()` will attempt to consume the *next* character, which for `<p =a>` is `>`. For `<a =a` (at the end of the input string), the `tq` might already be empty after consuming `a`, leading to `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when `tq.consume()` is called again.\n    *   **Case 2: No `key` and no `=` (e.g., `<p >` or `<p <tag>`)**\n        Here, `key` will be `\"\"`, and `tq.matchChomp(\"=\")` will be false. No value is parsed. The `tq` is still positioned at the character that prevented a key (e.g., `>` or `<`). The `else` block again executes `tq.consume()`. This incorrectly consumes the tag-closing character (`>`) or another significant character that the caller (the `Tokeniser`) should handle.\n\nThe fix involves removing the `tq.consume()` call from the `else` block. If `key` is empty, it means no valid attribute key was found.\n*   If an `=` and a value were subsequently parsed (meaning `hasEq` is true), the function has already consumed the malformed attribute part (`=value`), so it can simply return `null` to indicate no *valid* attribute was formed.\n*   If no `=` and no value were parsed (`hasEq` is false), the `tq` is still at the character that caused the empty key (e.g., a tag closing character). In this case, `parseAttribute` should return `null` without consuming that character, letting the caller handle it.\n\nBy removing `tq.consume()` in the `else` branch, we ensure that the function either returns a valid `Attribute` object or returns `null` without causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrectly consuming characters that belong to the tag structure.\n",
