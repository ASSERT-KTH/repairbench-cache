    "generation": "    long instantLocal = instantMillis + chrono.getZone().getOffset(instantMillis);\n    ```\n    `instantMillis` is the `instant`'s milliseconds in UTC. `chrono.getZone().getOffset(instantMillis)` is the offset at that UTC instant.\n    The `instantLocal` variable effectively represents the `instant`'s local time *as if it were in the UTC timezone*.\n    For `new MutableDateTime(2004, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, NEWYORK)`:\n    *   `instantMillis` would be the UTC milliseconds for `2004-01-01T05:00:00.000Z` (since NEWYORK is GMT-5).\n    *   `chrono.getZone().getOffset(instantMillis)` would be `-5 hours` (`-18000000` ms).\n    *   `instantLocal` would be `instantMillis + (-18000000)` = milliseconds for `2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`.\n\n2.  **`defaultYear` calculation**:\n    ```java\n    int defaultYear = chrono.year().get(instantLocal);\n    ```\n    Here, `chrono` is `instant.getChronology()`, which is `ISOChronology.getInstance(NEWYORK)`.\n    So, it's asking for the year of `2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` when interpreted by `ISOChronology.getInstance(NEWYORK)`.\n    `2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` in `NEWYORK` timezone (GMT-5) corresponds to `2003-12-31T19:00:00.000` (7 PM on Dec 31, 2003).\n    Therefore, `defaultYear` is incorrectly calculated as `2003`. Since 2003 is not a leap year, this causes the `IllegalFieldValueException` when parsing \"2 29\".\n    The intent of the method description (\"parses using the year from the supplied instant based on the chronology and time-zone of the supplied instant\") is that the year should be 2004.\n\n3.  **`DateTimeParserBucket` initialization**:\n    ```java\n    DateTimeParserBucket bucket = new DateTimeParserBucket(\n        instantLocal, chrono, iLocale, iPivotYear, defaultYear);\n    ```\n    The `DateTimeParserBucket` constructor immediately converts the provided `Chronology` to UTC: `iChrono = chrono.withUTC();`.\n    It then sets `iMillis = instantLocal`.\n    So, internally the bucket has:\n    *   `iMillis`: milliseconds for `2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` (which is the UTC equivalent of `instantLocal`).\n    *   `iChrono`: `ISOChronology.getInstanceUTC()`.\n    This pairing is actually consistent, meaning `iMillis` (representing `2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`) when used with `UTCChronology` should correctly identify the year as 2004. So, this part *alone* was not the cause of the leap year validation failure if the `defaultYear` was correctly 2004.\n\n**The primary bug is the incorrect `defaultYear` calculation.** It inadvertently shifts the year to 2003 for instants around year boundaries in specific timezones.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n1.  **Correct `defaultYear` calculation**: The `defaultYear` should be derived from the `instant`'s actual date and time, using its own chronology and zone, without shifting to \"local UTC\" milliseconds. `instant.getChronology().year().get(instant.getMillis())` correctly yields 2004.\n2.  **Consistent `DateTimeParserBucket` initialization**: While the original `instantLocal` as `iMillis` wasn't the direct cause of the leap year bug, it's better practice to provide the `DateTimeParserBucket` with `instant.getMillis()` (the original UTC milliseconds) as its base, since the bucket's internal chronology is forced to UTC. This ensures internal consistency with the `UTCChronology` used by the bucket.\n",
